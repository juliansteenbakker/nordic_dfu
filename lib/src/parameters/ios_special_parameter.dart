  /// connection and do not expect direct advertising unless bonded. This causes thiose
  /// packets being missed and not reported to the library, making reconnection to the
  /// bootloader and proceeding with DFU impossible.
  /// A solution requires modifying either the bootloader not to use the direct advertising,
  /// or the application not to share the peer data with bootloader, in which case it will
  /// advertise undirectly using address +1, like it does when the switch to bootloader mode
  /// is initiated with a button. After such modification, setting this flag to true will make the
  /// library scan for the bootloader using `DFUPeripheralSelector`.

  /// performed tests, such delay is sufficient.

  /// The longer the delay, the more time DFU will take to complete (delay will be repeated for
  /// each data object (4096 bytes)). However, with too small delay a packet lose may occur,
  /// causing the service to enable PRN and set them to 1 making DFU process very, very slow
  /// (but reliable).
